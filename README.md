# Analysis code for (arXiv: ######)

This is the analysis code built on top of **lsdensities** code (
<a href="https://github.com/LupoA/lsdensities"> GitHub repository </a>) to
reproduce the results in **(arXiv: ######)**.

## Set up environment

Download this code and download the data release files in doi:10.5281/zenodo.11048346.
From there, put ``chimera_data_full.hdf5`` in ``input_correlators/`` and the content of 
``input_topology.zip`` in ``input_topology/``.

Then, create the conda environment in terminal with conda installed:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Once the environment is created, you can active it:

```
conda activate analysis-env
```

## Code usage

To reproduce all the plots that are shown in the papers, deriving from 
spectral density findings and GEVP (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 10 left panel, 11 left panel, 12 left panel, 13 left panel), run 
``bash run_plots.sh``. To do so, ensure that the CSVs in ``plateaus/CSVs`` are full. Please, also ensure that ``

To find all the spectral densities from scratch and exactly how they have been used in the paper,
ensure that the HDF5 file containing all the data is present in the 
directory ``input_correlators/``, and then run ``bash run_spectral_densities.sh``.

Spectral density fits (Figs. 7, 15, 10 right panel, 11 right panel, 12 right panel, 13 right panel) can be reproduced by using the example code in LSDensities 
``lsd_out/lsdensities/examples/runFitRho.py``.

To find all the GEVP plateaus results from scratch, selecting the plateaus
extents by hand, run ``bash run_plateaus.sh``. Firstly, ensure that the HDF5
file containing all the data is present in the  directory ``input_correlators/``.
