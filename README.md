# Analysis code for (arXiv:2405.01388)

This is the analysis code built on top of **lsdensities** code (
<a href="https://github.com/LupoA/lsdensities"> GitHub repository </a>) to
reproduce the results in **([arXiv:2405.01388][paper])**.

## Set up environment

* Download this code
* From the data release at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11048346
  * Download ``chimera_data_full.hdf5``, and place it in ``input_correlators/``
  * Download ``input_topology.zip``,
    and extract its contents into    ``input_topology/``
  * Download ``input_fit/``,
    and extract its contentse into ``input_fit/``.


* Then, create the conda environment in terminal with conda installed:

      conda env create -f environment.yml
  
  with the caveat that if you're using an Apple silicon CPU then you need to use Conda 24.3 or later, and specify ```--platform osx-64```
  in your ```conda env create``` call.


* Once the environment is created, you can active the it:

      conda activate analysis-env

## Code usage

* The whole analysis can be done automatically:

   * Make sure that ``input_fit/``, ``input_topology/`` and ``input_correlators/`` contain the relevant files from the data release,
   as discussed above.
   * To reproduce all the plots and results in the tables present in the paper, please run
     ``reproduce_everything.sh``. The results will be found in ``plots/`` and ``tables/``.


* Otherwise, each individual step can be achieved separately:

   * Make sure that ``input_topology/`` is full. To reproduce all the plots that are shown in the paper, run 
     ``bash run_plots.sh``.  The results will be found in ``plots/``.

   * Make sure that the HDF5 file containing all the data is present in the 
     directory ``input_correlators/`` before running ``bash run_spectral_densities.sh``.

     The spectral densities can be found and fitted:
      * If ``input_fit/`` has been filled (using the corresponding directory in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11048346)
        the fitting procedure will be applied to pre-reconstructed spectral densities.
      * If ``input_fit/`` is empty, the code will reconstruct from scratch the spectral densities and then
        to fit them. This procedure may take quite a long time.
  
     Either way, to do so, run ``run_spectral_densities.sh``. 

   * Make sure that the HDF5 file containing all the data is present in the  directory ``input_correlators/``. The 
     command ``bash run_plateaus.sh`` reproduces the GEVP plateaus by using the  metadata used for the analysis in the paper.
